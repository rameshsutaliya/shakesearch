# ShakeSearch

Welcome to the Pulley Shakesearch Take-home Challenge! In this repository,
you'll find a simple web app that allows a user to search for a text string in
the complete works of Shakespeare.

You can see a live version of the app at
https://pulley-shakesearch.herokuapp.com/. Try searching for "Hamlet" to display
a set of results.

In it's current state, however, the app is just a rough prototype. The search is
case sensitive, the results are difficult to read, and the search is limited to
exact matches.

## Your Mission

Improve the search backend. Think about the problem from the **user's perspective**
and prioritize your changes according to what you think is most useful. 

## Evaluation

We will be primarily evaluating based on how well the search works for users. A search result with a lot of features (i.e. multi-words and mis-spellings handled), but with results that are hard to read would not be a strong submission. 


## Submission

1. Fork this repository and send us a link to your fork after pushing your changes. 
2. Heroku hosting - The project includes a Heroku Procfile and, in its
current state, can be deployed easily on Heroku's free tier.
3. In your submission, share with us what changes you made and how you would prioritize changes if you had more time.

## Solved
1. Search Criteria from case-sensitive to case-insensitive.
2. Hard-bond text around query to dynamic single line output which has the query string.
3. Number of Search result with easy to view search strings.

## Can be solved the issues:
1. Substring mapping results, rather than Lookup: use the regex.
2. Large file search, by using the bufio package read the file in chuncks.
3. Search indexing, or prioritizing the search result output by using the elasticsearch.
